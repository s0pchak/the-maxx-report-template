# The Maxx Report

Local telemetry for extremely normal AI usage.

Count tokens. Question choices.

Are you even token maxxing, bro?

The Maxx Report is a static dashboard for local AI coding-assistant token usage. It reads local Codex and Claude Code transcript logs, bundles the result into `data/usage.json` and `data/usage.js`, and lets any static host serve the dashboard while your laptop is offline.

It is a local usage estimate, not OpenAI, Anthropic, or Render billing truth.

## What It Shows

- Total tokens across logged days.
- Stacked daily token bars by model.
- Session length overlay by day.
- Tokens and call counts by model.
- Provider labels for Codex and Claude Code.
- Hover details for the day you are inspecting.

## Privacy Model

This repository serves whatever is committed under `data/`.

- A private live repo can hold your real generated `data/usage.*` bundle.
- A public template repo should ship only sample or sanitized data.
- Static hosting serves the committed `data/usage.json` and `data/usage.js` files.
- Render and other static-site builds do not read your laptop logs.
- Running the updater locally is the only step that reads local Codex or Claude Code logs.

If you make your fork public, inspect `data/usage.json` before pushing.

## Quickstart

1. Create your own copy from the GitHub template or fork.
2. Clone your copy locally.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER/the-maxx-report.git
   cd the-maxx-report
   ```

3. Generate your dashboard data.

   ```bash
   tools/update_dashboard.sh
   ```

4. Commit and push the generated bundle if the updater did not do it for you.

   ```bash
   git add data/usage.json data/usage.js
   git commit -m "Update token dashboard data"
   git push
   ```

5. Create a Render static site from your repo. The included `render.yaml` keeps the site static and serves the committed bundle.

## Make It Yours With An Agent

This is the part where you burn a few more tokens to make the token dashboard about burning tokens.

After cloning your fork, give your coding agent a prompt like:

```text
Make this dashboard feel like my personal AI usage command center.
Keep the existing data importer and update workflow intact.
Rename the project, adjust the hero copy, tune the colors, and make the graph
and model breakdown look polished on desktop and mobile.
Do not publish private usage data. Keep sample data in public repos.
Run the existing tests and a browser smoke before committing.
```

Good customization targets:

- `index.html` for product name and hero copy.
- `styles.css` for visual treatment.
- `app.js` for labels, chart annotations, and tooltip copy.
- `README.md` for your fork's setup instructions.

Avoid changing `tools/refresh_token_data.py` unless you are adding a real provider or fixing importer behavior.

## Install The Shortcut

Install or update the local `dashboard` command from this checkout:

```bash
tools/install_dashboard_shortcut.sh
```

The installer creates `~/.local/bin/dashboard`, pointing at this checkout's `tools/update_dashboard.sh`.

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`, then refresh and publish from anywhere:

```bash
dashboard
dashboard --no-push
dashboard --no-commit
```

Re-run `tools/install_dashboard_shortcut.sh` after moving the checkout.

## Updating Data

Run from the dashboard checkout:

```bash
tools/update_dashboard.sh
```

The command regenerates `data/usage.json` and `data/usage.js`, validates the importer syntax, commits only those bundled data files when this directory is a Git worktree, and pushes the current branch to the configured remote.

Useful options:

```bash
tools/update_dashboard.sh --no-commit
tools/update_dashboard.sh --no-push
tools/update_dashboard.sh --remote origin
tools/update_dashboard.sh --message "Update dashboard data"
```

If the directory is not a Git worktree, or the configured remote does not exist, the command refreshes local files and reports that publishing was skipped.

## Configuration

The importer/update tooling can be configured with environment variables:

- `DASHBOARD_CODEX_DIRS`: comma-separated Codex transcript directories to scan. Defaults should cover the normal local Codex session locations.
- `DASHBOARD_CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR`: Claude Code projects directory to scan. Use this when Claude Code data lives outside the default location.
- `DASHBOARD_TIMEZONE`: IANA timezone used for daily grouping, such as `America/New_York`.
- `DASHBOARD_REMOTE`: Git remote used by the updater when pushing. Defaults to `origin`.
- `DASHBOARD_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: commit message used for generated data updates.

Example:

```bash
DASHBOARD_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles dashboard --no-push
```

## Render Hosting

`render.yaml` is configured as a Render static site. Its build command checks that `data/usage.json` and `data/usage.js` are present, then Render serves the repository root as static files.

To deploy:

1. Push a repo that contains committed `data/usage.json` and `data/usage.js`.
2. In Render, create a new Blueprint or static site from that repo.
3. Keep the service private if the committed data is private to you.

The cloud build does not run the local importer and does not read `~/.codex`, Claude Code project logs, or any other local machine files.

## Local Viewing

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the directory with any static file server.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8768 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8768/`.

## Publishing A Template

Before publishing a template repo:

- Replace real `data/usage.json` and `data/usage.js` with sample or sanitized data.
- Remove personal live-site links from documentation.
- Keep `render.yaml` fork-neutral so each user connects their own repo in Render.

## Scope

This dashboard summarizes local transcript usage events. It is useful for personal trend tracking, model mix review, and rough assistant-usage visibility. It is not account billing truth.
